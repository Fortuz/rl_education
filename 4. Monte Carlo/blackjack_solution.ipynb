    "Blackjack is a card game where the goal is to beat the dealer by obtaining cards that sum to closer to 21 (without going over 21) than the dealers cards.\n",
    "The game starts with the dealer having one face up and one face down card, while the player has two face up cards. All cards are drawn from an infinite deck (i.e. with replacement).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/blackjack.gif\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The card values are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) have a point value of 10.\n",
    "- Aces can either count as 11 (called a ‘usable ace’) or 1.\n",
    "- Numerical cards (2-9) have a value equal to their number.\n",
    "\n",
    "The player has the sum of cards held. The player can request additional cards (*hit*) until they decide to stop (*stick*) or exceed 21 (*bust*, immediate loss).\n",
    "After the player sticks, the dealer reveals their facedown card, and draws cards until their sum is 17 or greater. If the dealer goes bust, the player wins.\n",
    "If neither the player nor the dealer busts, the outcome (win, lose, draw) is decided by whose sum is closer to 21. If the player has 21 immediately (an ace and a 10-card),\n",
    "it is called a *natural*. The player then wins unless the dealer also has a natural, in which case the game is a draw.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use the `Blackjack-v1` environment of the `Gymnasium` library. The states are 3-component tuples, where the components are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The player's current sum (0 - 31)\n",
    "2. The dealer's face up card (1 - 10, where 1 is Ace)\n",
    "3. Whether the player has a usable ace (0 for no, 1 for yes)\n",
    "\n",
    "An action is either 0 (stick) or 1 (hit). The reward is +1 for winning the game, -1 for losing, and 0 for a draw.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example uses an *Off-policy Monte Carlo* algorithm to approximate the optimal policy.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Off-policy Monte Carlo Control\n",
    "\n",
    "*Monte Carlo* (MC) methods are iterative processes for finding the optimal policy and state-value function, similarly to Value Iteration. However, instead\n",
    "of doing sweeps of the complete state set, MC algorithms only simulate episodes. *Off-policy* means that the policy used to simulate episodes (*behaviour policy*) is different\n",
    "from the policy learned (*target policy*): in this case, the target policy is a deterministic policy $\\pi$, while the behaviour policy $b$ is an $\\varepsilon$-greedy policy, that\n",
    "uses $\\pi$'s state-value function to determine the best action for each state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider the *On-policy* version of this method first, that is, where the policy used to generate the episodes, $b$ is identical to the policy being evaulated, $\\pi$. We simulate an episode using the policy, and save the resulting trajectory: $S_0, A_0, R_1, S_1, A_1, ..., S_{T-1}, A_{T-1}, R_T$ ($T$ is the terminal time step).\n",
    "Looping backwards through the trajectory, we calculate the returns for each step, and update our value function so that the value of each state-action pair will be the\n",
    "average of the returns observed after visiting that state and taking that action. After that, we update the policy according to the new action-value function. As long as the policy is $\\varepsilon$-greedy, this method will converge to the best $\\varepsilon$-soft policy (a policy is $\\varepsilon$-soft if $\\pi(a|s) > \\frac{\\varepsilon}{|\\mathcal{A}(S_t)|}$ for all $a, s$).\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the Off-policy method uses different behaviour and target policies. In this case, when updating the action-value function, we have to take into account\n",
    "the difference between $\\pi(a|s)$ and $b(a|s)$, since we use data generated by using $b$ to better estimate the action-value function of $\\pi$. We can account for this difference\n",
    "by calculating the *importance-sampling ratio*:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\rho_{t:T-1} := \\prod_{k=t}^{T-1} \\frac{\\pi(A_k|S_k)}{b(A_k|S_k)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The state-action value is then determined by the weighted average of all previous returns:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Q(s,a) := \\frac{\\sum_{t\\in\\mathcal{T}(s,a)} \\rho_{t:T(t)-1} G_t}{\\sum_{t\\in\\mathcal{T}(s,a)} \\rho_{t:T(t)-1}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $T(t)$ is the terminal time step of the episode where $t$ is sampled from, and $\\mathcal{T}(s,a)$ denotes the set of all time steps where action $a$ was selected in state $s$ (in any episode).\n",
    "\n",
    "Weighing the returns with the importance-sampling ratio lets us update the action-value function of $\\pi$ using only data generated with $b$. Using this method we are not limited\n",
    "to just $\\varepsilon$-soft methods: while the behaviour policy is more exploratory, the target policy can be deterministic."
