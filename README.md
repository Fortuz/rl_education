# Reinforcement Learning Course
Education materials for a Reinforcement Learning Course. This course aims to go through some of the base concept of reinforcement learnig. Starting from the K-armed bandit problem, introducing the Markov Decision Process (MDP). Implementing Dynamic Programming, Monte Carlo and Temporal Differenc algorithms in a practical way. The core material follows the structure of the Sutton-Barton book
