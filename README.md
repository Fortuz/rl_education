# Reinforcement Learning Course
Education materials for a Reinforcement Learning Course. This course aims to go through some of the base concept of reinforcement learnig. Starting from the K-armed bandit problem, introducing the Markov Decision Process (MDP). Implementing Dynamic Programming, Monte Carlo and Temporal Differenc algorithms in a practical way. The core material follows the structure of the Sutton-Barton book 

## Installation

The notebooks can be run directly online in google colab or offline in a docker container on a local machine. For the docker container installation see the [guide](https://github.com/Fortuz/rl_education/blob/main/assets/install.md).
