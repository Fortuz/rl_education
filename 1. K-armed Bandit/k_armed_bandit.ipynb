    "Consider the following learning problem. You are faced repeatedly with a choice among\n",
    "$k$ different options, or actions. After each choice, you receive a numerical reward\n",
    "from a stationary probability distribution that depends on the action you selected. Your\n",
    "objective is to maximize the expected total reward over some time period, for example,\n",
    "over 1000 action selections, or time steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called the $k$-armed bandit problem. You can visualize this problem as having to\n",

    "The $k$-armed bandit problem illustrates an important problem in reinforcement\n",
    "learning: **exploration vs. exploitation**. At each time step $t$, the agent has to make a decision:\n",
    "take the action with the highest expected reward according to its current knowledge of the environment, \n",
    "or choose a different action to get a better estimation of the value of that action. The former is called an\n",
    "*exploitation* step, because it exploits the current knowledge of the agent in order to obtain a high reward.\n",
    "The latter is called an *exploration* step, since it involves trying out an action in order to have a better\n",
    "estimation of its value, thereby exploring the environment.\n",
