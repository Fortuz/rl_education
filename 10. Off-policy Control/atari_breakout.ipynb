    "# Atari Breakout\n",
    "\n",
    "Breakout is a famous Atari game. The dynamics are similar to pong: You move a paddle and hit the ball in a brick wall at the top of the screen. Your goal is to destroy the brick wall. You can try to break through the wall and let the ball wreak havoc on the other side, all on its own! You have five lives.\n",

    "This environment runs the actual Atari game in an emulator. The observation space is `Box(0, 255, (210, 160, 3), np.uint8)`, meaning we have a 210x160 RGB image at every time step. There are 4 possible actions: NOOP, FIRE, RIGHT and LEFT, where FIRE is only used to start a new round after the ball has fallen down. You get rewards for destroying bricks in the wall, different color bricks yield different rewards. For a more detailed documentation, see the AtariAge page linked below.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses *Deep Q-Learning (DQN)* to train an agent to play Breakout. We will follow the original DQN paper (Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning, Mnih et. al.)\n",
